PING: Transmit failed. General Failure - Reasons and Solution
By Alex George

Yesterday I faced Internet connectivity issues on my computer, and the troubleshooting ended up with an error message PING: Transmit failed. General Failure.

I received this error when I ping the loopback address. I tried to ping a different loopback address, but that too faced the same fate.

However, I fixed the PING: Transmit failed General Failure error on my computer by following a set of troubleshooting methods.

This tutorial explains the reasons to receive PING: Transmit failed General Failure error and how to solve it.


Let you show you the screenshot I took from my Windows PC, before explaining the meaning of PING: Transmit failed General Failure message.



PING: transmit failed. General failure means I lost all the ping packets I sent to the loopback address.

C:\Users\sijugk>ping 127.0.0.21

Pinging 127.0.0.21 with 32 bytes of data:
PING: transmit failed. General failure.
PING: transmit failed. General failure.
PING: transmit failed. General failure.
PING: transmit failed. General failure.

Ping statistics for 127.0.0.21:
   Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 0, Lost = 4 (100% loss)

Reasons for Getting PING: transmit failed. General failure
One of the major reasons to receive PING transmit failed General failure error is the wrong TCP/IP and DNS settings. Firewall misconfiguration and Network adapter driver issues can also be a reason.

Corrupted TCP/IP suite

Misconfigured Firewall

Outdated Network drivers or firmware

DNS and other socket issues

Other software or hardware errors


The solution for Ping: Transmit failed. General Failure
To fix the PING transmit failed General failure error, follow the instructions provided below.


Reset the TCP/IP suite and Flush the DNS Cache on your computer
The first step to troubleshoot the PING transmit failed General failure error on a Windows computer is to perform flush DNS cache and reset TCP/IP suite.


Type netsh int ip reset c:\tcp.txt on command prompt and press enter key.

Type ipconfig /flushdns on the command prompt and press enter key

Reboot your computer.

Check for the issue. If you still receive the same error, proceed to the next steps.

You will get this error message if you ping an up that simply doesn't exist.

 message when I ping from my wireless adapter. But there is no problem with Ethernet adapter.. So strange !!

Check for the issue. If you still receive the same error, proceed to the next steps.



Disable Firewall (and other security programs ) and check for the issue: Sometimes you may get this message "PING: Transmit failed. General Failure" when firewall stops packets.



Perform a System Restore to the last known good configuration

Power Cycle the entire network:
To know more about this step, go to the link below.
How to perform the power cycle

Update the Network Adapter driver:
To perform this step follow the instructions provided in the link below.
How to Update Adapter Driver from Device Manager

Perform a Windows Socket Reset
Execute the following commands on command prompt to renew IP address and reset Windows Socket on your laptop.

ipconfig/release

ipconfig/renew

netsh winsock reset

Update the modem and router (if any) firmware


Just like this guide for "Ping: Transmit failed. General Failure" error message, we have a troubleshooting guide for some other important Internet connectivity error messages.

Some of them with the connection error codes are Error 718: Connection was terminated, and Error 777: Connection Attempt failed.



When I optimized the Windows 10 settings on my laptop, I faced some similar ICMP error codes. Destination Net Unreachable and Destination Host Unreachable were the commonly occurred error messages.

For those visiting, looking for an answer, I had the same issue in a VMware machine which i was moving from one domain to another. The fix was to remove the existing VM NIC then install a new NIC. Interestingly Windows 7 told me that the IP I assigned to the new NIC was already assigned to the old NIC, eventhough the old NIC was no longer available and that I may have issues when the old NIC was made available (which it would not as I had deleted it from the VMware config for that server).

Once I entered the same IP information against the new NIC it worked like a charm!

hi,
this problem has only occured for me when I resumed the PC from hibernation. A normal reboot always solved it, but I'd still like to know WHY does it happen.

Hi Arnold,

Is the issue persists ?

Loopback I.p. Is 127.0.0.1
You will get this error message if you ping an up that simply doesn't exist.

Siju George10:41 AM
127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 is mapped to loop back address and you should get valid reply if you ping an IP address in this range from your computer.

I don't know if that will be helpful or not, but if the problem arises in wireless connection it could be because of "WAP Pre-Shared Key", someone might have changed it and may have forgot to update you that he has done it, so, just updating the Pre-Shared Key would do the trick.

Thanks
